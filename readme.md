# Symfony Webshop

**Due to bad planning on at the start, and lack of time this project will be archived.
it can serve as an example on how to implement a VueJS site next to Symfony site.**


This is a project written to show to people asking for a "code sample".
The reason for a web shop is that it has CRUD action, front-end and back-end.

It is a good all round project to make, due to this being developed solely in my free time
progress is not as fast as I would want it too.
